## Project Overview

This experimental series explores what's possible when we push AI video generation tools to their limits. Each piece tests different aspects of AI cinema: character consistency, emotional pacing, hybrid footage blending, and iterative refinement.

## Creative Process

### Pre-Production

We began with a simple premise: can AI-generated footage convey genuine emotion? Rather than treating AI as a special effects tool, we approached it as a primary cinematographer.

- **Scriptwriting**: Short vignettes focused on universal emotions (joy, loss, wonder)
- **Style Development**: Created reference boards blending noir aesthetics with sci-fi elements
- **Audio Design**: Recorded foley and ambient sound first to guide visual generation

### Production Workflow

1. **Initial Generation**: Runway Gen-3 for establishing shots
2. **Character Consistency**: Midjourney + video-to-video workflows for actor-like consistency
3. **Motion Refinement**: Iterative prompting to achieve natural camera movement
4. **Hybrid Blending**: Combined AI shots with real macro footage of rain, light, textures

### Post-Production

Final assembly in DaVinci Resolve. Color grading was crucial—AI-generated footage often has a "digital sheen" that needs warming. We added film grain and subtle vignetting to ground the visuals in cinematic tradition.

## Technical Challenges

- **Temporal Coherence**: Maintaining visual consistency across cuts
- **Uncanny Valley**: Balancing stylization vs. realism
- **Prompt Engineering**: Discovering that less-specific prompts often yield more organic results

## Results

The final piece runs 90 seconds. Viewers in test screenings couldn't identify which shots were AI vs. real footage—mission accomplished. The emotional beats landed, proving that AI can serve storytelling when wielded with intention.

## Tools Used

- Runway Gen-3
- Midjourney
- DaVinci Resolve
- Adobe Audition
- Topaz Video AI (upscaling)
