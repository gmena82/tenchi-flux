## Concept

**Neon Noir** is a proof-of-concept music video set in a rain-soaked cyberpunk cityscape. The project demonstrates how AI tools can rapidly prototype entire cinematic worlds without traditional 3D modeling or location scouting.

## Visual Development

### World Building

We created a fictional city called **Neo-Akihabara**, blending Tokyo's neon-drenched streets with dystopian undertones. The entire environment was generated through iterative AI prompting:

- **Architecture**: Layered Midjourney generations for building facades, alleyways, holographic billboards
- **Atmosphere**: Consistent rain, fog, and volumetric lighting across all shots
- **Color Palette**: Limited to cyan, magenta, and amber to maintain visual cohesion

### Character Design

Our protagonist is a "data courier" navigating the city. We maintained character consistency through:

1. Reference sheet generation (Midjourney)
2. Img2img workflows to preserve facial features
3. Video generation with locked character prompts

## Production Pipeline

```
1. Concept Art (Midjourney) → 2. Animatic (After Effects) → 3. Video Generation (Runway/Pika) → 4. Post (DaVinci)
```

### Shot Breakdown

- **Opening**: Aerial city flyover (Runway Gen-3, 4-second clips stitched)
- **Street Level**: Character moving through crowd (Pika 1.5 with motion brush)
- **Close-ups**: Emotional beats, rain on face (Kling AI for micro-expressions)
- **Climax**: Data upload sequence with abstract glitch visuals (custom ComfyUI workflow)

## Music Integration

The track (synthwave instrumental) was created first. We analyzed the audio waveform to time visual beats:

- Bass drops → camera zooms
- Synth swells → color grade shifts
- Drum hits → quick cuts

## Challenges

1. **Rain Consistency**: AI struggles with persistent weather. Solution: generated rain overlays separately, composited in post.
2. **Camera Movement**: AI-generated camera motion can feel floaty. We stabilized in post and added subtle shake.
3. **Crowd Scenes**: Background characters often morph. We embraced this as a stylistic "glitch aesthetic."

## Reception

Released as a demo reel, the video garnered interest from electronic music artists seeking unique visuals. It proves that AI workflows can deliver music video-quality content in days, not weeks.

## Tools

- Midjourney (concept art)
- Runway Gen-3 (primary video generation)
- Pika 1.5 (motion control)
- Kling AI (facial expressions)
- DaVinci Resolve (editing, color, VFX)
- After Effects (compositing, titles)
