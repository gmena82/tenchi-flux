# Prospect Sandboxes

Each folder in here is a lightweight copy of a template that we can
customize quickly for a specific lead without touching the canonical
starter projects at the repo root.

Workflow:
1. Duplicate the base template into a new `potential-client-XX` folder.
2. Strip the scope down to whatever we want to show (usually the home page).
3. Document any placeholder assets, copy points, or data we still need from the client in that folder's `README.md`.

Once a prospect converts, promote their folder into a full project or sync the final copy back into the appropriate template repo.
