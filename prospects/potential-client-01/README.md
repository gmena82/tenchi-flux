# Potential Client 01

This sandbox is a direct copy of the `aesthetic-tile-website-next` template so we can prototype an Electronics House style home page without touching the base template.

## How to work in this folder

1. `cd prospects/potential-client-01`
2. `pnpm install` (runs independently from the root template install)
3. `pnpm dev` to preview at http://localhost:3000 (or the next open port)

## TODO before sharing with the prospect

- [ ] Swap hero media with Electronics House storefront/device imagery
- [ ] Replace hero headline + body copy with buy / sell / repair value prop
- [ ] Update service cards to highlight "New Tech Gadgets", "Expert Repairs", and "Easy Payment Options"
- [ ] Replace testimonials and FAQs with electronics-specific proof points
- [ ] Ensure CTAs route to the proper quote / call flows for Electronics House
- [ ] Purge leftover tile-related copy before exporting a preview build
